Hello! I am an economist and a legal scholar, and I currently serve as a Senior Liman Research Affiliate at Yale Law School. I am also currently serving as a judicial law clerk. Beginning in Summer 2022 I will be an Associate Professor of Law at Duke University.

My economics research is in the field of public economics, and my current legal research includes topics in empirical civil procedure, federal &amp; state courts, access to justice, employment &amp; labor law, and tax. I am broadly interested in the legal and economic organization of large public institutions (especially the U.S. military and state and federal courts in the U.S.), and I'm especially interested in how such institutions intersect with and influence the lives of economically or socially vulnerable constituencies.

I hold a JD from Yale Law School (2019) and a PhD in economics from MIT (2020), and I'm also a graduate of Swarthmore College (2007) and the terrific public schools of Beaverton, Oregon. Before returning to academia I served as an active-duty officer in the U.S. Marine Corps, and I'm a veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan.
