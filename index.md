Hello! I am an economist and a legal scholar, and I currently serve as a Senior Liman Research Affiliate at Yale Law School. I am also currently serving as a judicial law clerk. My economics research is in the field of public economics, and my current legal research includes topics in empirical civil procedure, federal &amp; state courts, access to justice, employment &amp; labor law, and tax. I am broadly interested in the legal and economic organization of large public institutions (especially the U.S. military and state and federal courts in the U.S.).

I hold a JD from Yale Law School (2019) and a PhD in economics from MIT (2020). Before grad school I served as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps.
