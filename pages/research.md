#### <u>Nudges for Judges: The Effects of the “Six-Month” List on Federal Civil Justice</u>({{ BASE_PATH}}/pages/working_papers/Petkun_SixMoList_May2021.pdf)

Recent court reform efforts in the United States have focused on speeding up what is perceived to be a slow and burdensome federal civil justice system. But how is speed best achieved, and at what cost to other goals of the civil justice system? I study a Congressionally-enacted reform known as the "six-month list," which uses social pressure to incentivize federal judges to decide cases more quickly. After constructing an original dataset of nearly 500,000 federal district court motions&mdash;representing the approximate universe of summary judgment motions in federal civil cases for the period 2005-2014&mdash;I exploit quasi-random variation in exposure to the six-month list in order to answer two related questions. First, does the six-month list accomplish its ostensible goal of promoting speedier adjudications? And second, how does the six-month list affect the quality of civil adjudications? My results indicate that the six-month list does indeed improve speed; the summary judgment motions that are most exposed to the six-month list are resolved almost a full month (15%) faster than those that are least exposed, and overall case durations are similarly impacted. I also find considerable heterogeneity across judges, with young judges, minority judges, and women judges being among the most responsive to the incentives created by the six-month list. Speedier adjudications notwithstanding, I find only mixed evidence of effects on the quality of adjudications. Finally, estimates from a bunching exercise suggest that the six-month list reduces total motion disposition time by approximately 4% relative to a counterfactual scenario in which the six-month list is eliminated. My results suggest that&mdash;
at least among federal judges&mdash;
social pressure can be a key driver of workplace behavior. I interpret these results as consistent with a model of judicial behavior that combines elements of career concerns, procrastination, and multitasking. I conclude with a discussion of normative implications, including a brief discussion of how the six-month list could be redesigned to capitalize on its best features while minimizing the potential for unintended consequences.

#### <u>I Want You! (But Not You): Selection in Military Retention (with Christina Patterson and William Skimmyhorn)</u>({{ BASE_PATH}}/pages/working_papers/MilitarySelection_Draft_Spring2021_20210427.pdf)

Government workers provide essential goods and services, but how do public sector compensation policies shape workforce quality? We expand the existing literature, which has focused on compensation levels, by studying how the structure of retention incentives affects employee quality in the U.S. military. Combining administrative data with quasi-random policy variation, we find that low-ability soldiers are relatively more responsive to both lump-sum bonuses and early retirement benefits, and both effects are large enough to affect the organization's average ability level. We provide suggestive evidence that neither access to credit nor differences in personal discount rates explain these selection patterns.
